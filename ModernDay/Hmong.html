    The Hmong migrated from southern China in the nineteenth century to the mountainous areas of Laos, Vietnam and Thailand. 
    During the Vietnam War the Hmong worked with the American CIA in the “secret war” in Laos, 
    and therefore were forced to flee their homeland after the victory of the communists. 
    After spending time in refugee camps in Thailand, many Hmong settled in a third country including Australia, France, Canada, Germany and the United States.
    
    Have you ever wondered what life was like for a typical Hmong family in Laos? The Hmong people were farmers, most living in small villages high in the mountains. 
    After helping the American CIA during the Vietnam War, the Hmong people were forced to flee for their lives. The old way of life was very different from their new way of life.
    
    There are only two seasons in Laos, the rainy season and the dry season. It is warm year around. Homes and other buildings are made of bamboo and wood. 
    There is no electricity for the mountain people, no machinery, and no roads.
    The Hmong walk to their farms and carry home the produce. All work is done by hand. They grow and make everything needed to sustain the family. 
    They were independent self-sufficient people.

    In the early 1960’s, the U.S. CIA sought out the Hmong and recruited them to fight a “secret war” against the North Vietnamese and the communist Pathet Lao.  
    The Hmong played many critical roles under the directions of the U.S. CIA, including harassing the communists on the Ho Chi Minh Trail, providing intelligence about enemy operations,
     guarding U.S. strategic radar installation, and rescuing down American pilots.

After the war in 1973, the Hmong were singled out by the victorious communist governments of Laos and Vietnam.  
The Hmong were hunted down, taken to concentration camps, put into hard labor and persecuted.  Their villages were sprayed with chemical weapons and bombed with napalm. 
 It is estimated that more than 10% (35,000) of the entire Hmong population in Laos died as a result of the war and its aftermath.  
Many who survived suffered physically, mentally, and emotionally until this day.

    Unlike past immigrant groups, the Hmong were political refugees who fled their country because of war and persecutions. 
    The Hmong refugees were legally admitted to the United States by the U.S. government and were initially resettled by church organizations such as Catholic Charities and 
    Lutheran Social Service.  Area churches sponsored Hmong families here in Wisconsin and other states in the U.S. 
    The 2010 U.S. Census has shown that there are 49,240 Hmong Americans living in Wisconsin. 
    Community with significant Hmong population include: Milwaukee, Wausau, Sheboygan, La Crosse, Madison, Eau Claire, Green Bay, Appleton, Oshkosh, Manitowoc, Stevens Point, 
    Wisconsin Rapids, Menomonie, and Fond du Lac.

Hmong culture places great importance on the family.  Most Hmong move to Wisconsin from other states to join with families, relatives, and clan leaders.  
Wisconsin also provides opportunities for Hmong families struggling to create a new life in the United States.  Wisconsin cities offer a peaceful and healthy lifestyle as well as educational 
opportunities for both children and adults.  Furthermore, Wisconsin provides agricultural opportunities such as farming and gardening for many Hmong families.
